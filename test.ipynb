       " Document(page_content='25\\nMANAGEMENT OF COMMERCIAL COURTS\\nOne of the key success factors in the transformation of economies is business’ confidence \\nin enforcement of contracts by the Courts. Both domestic and foreign investments \\nwhich are fundamental to economic growth involve entering of parties into commercial \\ncontracts. Often, contracts result in disputes that require proper and speedy adjudication \\nby the Courts. This facilitates faster execution of contracts and reduces business costs \\nand enhances returns on investment. \\nIn order to ensure that commercial contracts are enforced properly and business \\nactivities continue unimpeded, the Commercial Courts Act, 2015 was enacted and \\nCommercial Courts were established at the District levels. Five High Courts at Bombay, \\nCalcutta, Delhi, Himachal Pradesh and Madras exercise Original Civil Jurisdiction \\nwherein commercial divisions have been established.  The Act was amended in 2018. \\nThe specified value of the commercial disputes to be adjudicated by the Commercial \\nCourts is ₹3 lakhs. The Act simplifies the process of settlement of dispute by introducing \\nmechanism of Pre-Institution Mediation and Settlement (PIMS) where no interim relief \\nis contemplated.\\nThe mediation is to be conducted under the aegis of the State Legal Services Authority \\nand District Legal Services Authority as provided under the National Legal Services \\nAuthorities Act, 1987. On failure to resolve dispute through PIMS mechanism, the claimant \\ncan approach the Courts for resolution of their commercial dispute. The amendments \\nalso provide for establishment of Commercial Appellate Court at District level in such \\nterritories wherein the High Courts do not enjoy ordinary original civil jurisdiction and the \\ncommercial dispute case at the first instance is decided by a Court below the Court of \\nDistrict Judge.IV.

This application allows for real time monitoring of all Union of \\nIndia related cases, while also managing the fees for all the Law Officers, Panel Counsels \\nand Advocates associated with those cases. Earlier, officials had to line up in Courts \\nsimply to find the status of an order, now the same is available at the click of a button.\\nEqually significant is the initiative to digitalize the application process for Notaries. This \\nhas directly benefitted the citizens by allowing them to apply for Notaries online. The \\nlarger intent is to transform the entire end-to-end notarization process into a digitized \\nsystem that can be easily accessed and executed from the comfort of home.

The Appellate Tribunal allows the representatives of both the parties to appear \\nbefore it and hears them before passing any order. The Members hear the parties, peruse \\nthe evidence on record, make their own notes, refer to the authorities cited at the Bar, \\nconfer among themselves and then pass final orders. \\nPENDENCY OF APPEALS\\nNecessary instructions were issued to all the Benches to scrutinize and identify cases \\nwhich are covered by decisions of I.T.A.T., High Courts, and the Supreme Court and post \\nthem on priority basis.
